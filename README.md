# Sample Golang API Server

Sample REST API build using echo server.

The code implementation was inspired by port and adapter pattern or known as [hexagonal](blog.octo.com/en/hexagonal-architecture-three-principles-and-an-implementation-example):

-   **Business**<br/>Contains all the logic in domain business. Also called this as a service. All the interface of repository needed and the implementation of the service itself will be put here.
-   **Modules**<br/>Contains implementation of interfaces that defined at the business (also called as server-side adapters in hexagonal's term)
-   **Controller**<br/>Controller http handler or api (also called user-side adapters in hexagonal's term)

# Data initialization

To describe about how port and adapter interaction (separation concerned), this example will have two databases supported. There are MySQL using gorm as library.

# How To Run Server

Just execute code below in your console

```console
./run.sh
```

# How To Consume The API

To make it easier please download [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest) app and import [this collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favians/go-hexagonal/master/api/insomnia.json).
